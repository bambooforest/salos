# Introduction

From the [BivalTyp website](https://www.bivaltyp.info):

>>> BivalTyp is a typological database of bivalent verbs and their encoding frames. As of 2024, the database presents data for 129 languages, mainly spoken in Northern Eurasia. The database is based on a questionnaire containing 130 predicates given in context. Language-particular encoding frames are identified based on the devices (such as cases, adpositions, and verbal indices) involved in encoding two predefined arguments of each predicate (e.g. ‘Peter’ and ‘the dog’ in ‘Peter is afraid of the dog’). In each language, one class of verbs is identified as transitive. The goal of the project is to explore the ways in which bivalent verbs can be split between the transitive and different intransitive valency classes.

The data from BivalTyp are available in a GitHub repository created and maintained by [
Dmitry Nikolayev](https://dnikolaev.com):

* https://github.com/macleginn/bivaltyp

First, let's figure out where the [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) are.

***

Here we find a number of [CSV tabular data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files:

* https://github.com/macleginn/bivaltyp/tree/master/data

What are in these data files? Let's explore them.

OK, now how do we load the data into R/RStudio?

***

One way is to download them to your computer.

But then you need to make sure that they are:

1. Either in the same folder as the Rmd file you are working on (which means you've set the working directory to where you Rmd file is):

```{r, message=FALSE}
df <- read_tsv('data_for_download.csv')
```

2. You load the file from the working directory to where the data file is, e.g.:

```{r, message=FALSE}
df <- read_tsv('data/data_for_download.csv')
```

3. If the data are available online, e.g., in a GitHub repository (or elsewhere), you can load the data directly into R/RStudio with the ``url()`` function and a URL:

```{r, message=FALSE}
df <- read_tsv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macleginn/bivaltyp/master/data/data_for_download.csv'))
```

But be careful -- it has to be the URL to the **raw data**, not the webpage! Click on the "Raw" button in GitHub to get the URL in the browswer window.

Another issue to remember -- although the file is labeled CSV for "comma separated values", the actual file is separated by tabs. Linguists often use TSV (i.e., tab separted values) for display purposes.

In R/RStudio you can specify the [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter), e.g., that it is tab instead of comma. Comma is the default standard, but in the wild you will come across many different characters as delimiters.
